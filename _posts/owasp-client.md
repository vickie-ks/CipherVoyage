<div id="copyUrl"></div>

Hey everyone! Today, let's talk about something important for all of us who use the internet. You know how we all love using websites and apps? Well, there's a part of them called the client-side that can have some hidden dangers. Don't worry, though! We’re here to make it simple and easy to understand.

##### 1. Broken Client-side Access Control

Imagine you're at a friend's house, and suddenly, anyone can walk into any room without asking. That’s what happens when a website doesn’t control who can see what. We need to make sure only the right people can see certain parts.

##### 2. DOM-based XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

This is like letting a stranger write in your notebook. If a website lets users put in bad code, it can cause trouble for everyone. We need to stop bad scripts from running on our pages.

##### 3. Sensitive Data Leakage

Leaving your phone unlocked is risky, right? In the same way, websites shouldn’t show private info like passwords in the code where anyone can see it. Keeping data safe is a must.

##### 4. Vulnerable and Outdated Components

Using old tools is like driving an old car without brakes. Websites using outdated parts can have weak spots that hackers like to attack. It's always good to update and stay secure.

##### 5. Lack of Third-party Origin Control

If you buy snacks from an unknown shop, you never know if they’re fresh. Using scripts from unknown places can bring risks. Always check where your scripts are coming from.

##### 6. JavaScript Drift

Sometimes, our scripts wander away from what they should do, like daydreaming in class. We need to keep an eye on them and make sure they do their job right.

##### 7. Sensitive Data Stored Client-Side

Keeping secret things like passwords in your front pocket is not safe. Similarly, storing sensitive data on the client-side is risky. It's safer to keep it on the server.

##### 8. Client-side Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

Not watching over what's happening on your site is like leaving your house unlocked. Proper monitoring helps catch problems early, so always keep an eye out.

##### 9. Not Using Standard Browser Security Controls

Ignoring safety features on a website is like driving without a seatbelt. Browser controls like CSP help keep sites safe, so it’s smart to use them.

##### 10. Including Proprietary Information on the Client-Side

Sharing business secrets on the client-side is like giving away your special recipe. Keep important details on the server to keep them safe.

Exploring these risks might seem tricky, but understanding them can help keep our online world safe and fun.
